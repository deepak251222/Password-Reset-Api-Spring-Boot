Password Reset Api using spring boot

Project: Password Reset API with Spring Boot and Email

Description:
Developed a secure and user-friendly Password Reset API using Spring Boot to facilitate the password recovery process for users. The API allowed users to request a password reset link via email and securely reset their passwords.

Technologies Used:
- Spring Boot
- Java
- Spring Security
- JavaMail API (or any email library of your choice)

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints to handle password reset requests and password updates securely.
- Integrated Spring Security for user authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users could request password reset links.
- Utilized JavaMail API to send password reset emails to users with a unique link for password recovery.
- Implemented token-based authentication for the password reset link to maintain security and prevent misuse.
- Designed and coded password hashing and salting mechanisms to securely store and manage user passwords in the database.
- Implemented data validation and error handling to ensure the API's robustness and prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Conducted thorough testing to validate the API's functionality and security, including unit tests and end-to-end testing.
- Documented the API endpoints and usage guidelines to assist developers and stakeholders in integrating the functionality into their applications.
- Utilized version control (e.g., Git) to track code changes and collaborate effectively with the development team.

Results:
- Successfully delivered a reliable and secure Password Reset API, providing users with a seamless and safe password recovery process.
- Improved user experience by simplifying the password reset procedure and reducing support requests related to forgotten passwords.
- Received positive feedback from the development team and project stakeholders for meeting project objectives and maintaining code quality.
- Enhanced security measures, ensuring that user passwords were appropriately hashed and protected from potential breaches.
